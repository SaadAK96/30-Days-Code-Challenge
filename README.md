### Coding doesn’t matter your days. It matters your dedication and passion towards it.


Sometimes people beat themselves up over not doing enough and feeling disheartened, and I felt this so many times myself. But, don’t forget that the #30DaysOfCode is your personal challenge. You decide the rules, the environment, constraints, and rewards for yourself. Don’t get distracted by other people who seemingly learn faster, learn more, or build seemingly better projects. Everyone’s journey is different, and each and every one of us have our own battles to fight in the background.

So I encourage you to set a goal, it can be anything you choose, and work towards it for 30 days to strengthen your willpower and hopefully at the end of that time you will have accomplished something meaningful to you personally.
